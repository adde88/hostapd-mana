; Sample stunnel configuration file for Unix by Michal Trojnara 2002-2012
; Some options used here may be inadequate for your particular configuration

; A copy of some devices and system files is needed within the chroot jail
; Chroot conflicts with configuration file reload and many other features
; Remember also to update the logrotate configuration.
;chroot = /var/lib/stunnel4/
; Chroot jail can be escaped if setuid option is not used
;setuid = stunnel4
;setgid = stunnel4

; PID is created inside the chroot jail
pid = /var/run/stunnel4/hostapd-mana.pid

; Debugging stuff (may useful for troubleshooting)
;debug = 7
;output = /var/log/stunnel4/stunnel.log

; * Service defaults may also be specified in individual service sections  *

; Certificate/key is needed in server mode and optional in client mode
cert = /usr/share/hostapd-mana/cert/radius.pem
key = /usr/share/hostapd-mana/cert/radius.key

; Authentication stuff needs to be configured to prevent MITM attacks
; It is not enabled by default!
;verify = 2
; Don't forget to c_rehash CApath
; CApath is located inside chroot jail
;CApath = /certs
; It's often easier to use CAfile
;CAfile = /etc/stunnel/certs.pem
; Don't forget to c_rehash CRLpath
; CRLpath is located inside chroot jail
;CRLpath = /crls
; Alternatively CRLfile can be used
;CRLfile = /etc/stunnel/crls.pem

; Disable support for insecure SSLv2 protocol
options = NO_SSLv2
; Workaround for Eudora bug
;options = DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS

; These options provide additional security at some performance degradation
;options = SINGLE_ECDH_USE

; Example SSL server mode services

;[pop3s]
;accept  = 995
;connect = 110

;[imaps]
;accept  = 993
;connect = 143

;[ssmtp]
;accept  = 465
;connect = 25

; Example SSL client mode services

;[gmail-pop3]
;client = yes
;accept = 127.0.0.1:110
;connect = pop.gmail.com:995

;[gmail-imap]
;client = yes
;accept = 127.0.0.1:143
;connect = imap.gmail.com:993

;[gmail-smtp]
;client = yes
;accept = 127.0.0.1:25
;connect = smtp.gmail.com:465

; Example SSL front-end to a web server

[https]
accept  = 443
connect = 80
; "TIMEOUTclose = 0" is a workaround for a design flaw in Microsoft SSL
; Microsoft implementations do not use SSL close-notify alert and thus
; they are vulnerable to truncation attacks
